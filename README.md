# HarperDB "Who's A Good Boy" Custom Functions Template

HarperDB is proud to announce a new addition to our growing collection of free Custom Function project templates: Who’s A Good Boy?

Featured alongside our fully-compliant REST API template, Who’s A Good Boy? answers the most important question of these challenging modern times  in the affirmative, without fail.

“Affirmation is important. HarperDB believes that anyone capable of visiting our public demo endpoint deserves the sort of feedback that not only puts a smile on their face, but a wiggle in their walk.“, said Jaxon Repp, Head of Product for HarperDB.
